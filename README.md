# ffmpeg shell script
This is an installation script with ffmpeg with several extra libs, including NewTek NDI and VPX.

## Who is responsible for this?
- Victor Machado (rhz17) [shell]
- St√©phane Lepin (palakis) [NDI lib]
- immstudios [ffmpeg fork]

## Infos
* **ffmpeg-libvpx-ndi.sh** - Contains NDI and uses an ffmpeg fork (unofficial)
* **ffmpeg-libvpx.sh** - Does not contain NDI but uses the official ffmpeg build

Have fun
